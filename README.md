# Nix Articles

This is a series of articles about Nix.  This is for people who want to use Nix to:

* Build applications
* Package stuff
* Manage configuration and servers

It is a 5 part series so far:

1. [Environments with Nix Shell](https://www.sam.today/blog/environments-with-nix-shell-learning-nix-pt-1/)
2. [So Variables are a Thing](https://www.sam.today/blog/so-variables-are-a-thing-learning-nix-pt-2/)
3. [Creating a super simple derivation (package)](https://www.sam.today/blog/creating-a-super-simple-derivation-learning-nix-pt-3/)
4. Derivations 102
5. Grokking Nix functions with real usage examples

The publication of the later guides is pending editing.  Follow on GitHub or email me if you are interested.

The guides are aimed at a reader who:

* Knows basic programming concepts (variables, functions)
* How to install NixOS (maybe this tutorial works on Mac... IDK)
* Can use the [Search NixOS packages page](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html)
* Knows what the [Search NixOS options page](https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html) is for
